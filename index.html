          <h2 class="highlight">How to Protect Yourself From Coronavirus When Grocery Shopping</h2>
          <h2>Here are precautions to take whether you shop in-store or online</h2>
          <p class="about-us">With the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now recommending that people wear
            cloth, non-medical face coverings in public to help contain the spread of the coronavirus, you may wonder
            whether that's enough to keep you safe when you shop for food.

            The new CDC advisory, which is voluntary, specifically mentions groceries and pharmacies as public
            settings
            where it can be difficult to practice social distancing—that is, staying 6 feet from others—to prevent the
            spread of the coronavirus. In those locations, the CDC recommends wearing simple cloth face coverings "to
            slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting
            it
            to others."

            Many consumers are trying to avoid visiting grocery stores entirely, by turning to delivery services.

            But whether you buy groceries online or in stores, there are several steps that you can take to limit your
            exposure to coronavirus, and they’re not so different from what CR recommends you typically do. Be sure
            to:

            Wash nonporous containers. The FDA says there's no current evidence to support the transmission of the
            virus
            from food packaging. But if you're concerned, it can't hurt to wipe down non-porous containers like glass
            or
            cans with disinfectant wipes.


          </p>
          <h3 class="highlight">If You’re Getting Your Groceries Delivered</h3>
          <p>
            Even if a grocery store or warehouse is thoroughly cleaned on a regular basis, the delivery person needs
            to
            take the same precautions to prevent the spread of a virus to you.

            Among the six services in our review of grocery delivery services, AmazonFresh, Amazon Prime Now,
            Instacart,
            and Shipt employ independent contractors for deliveries. Instacart has begun offering up to 14 days of pay
            to all shoppers—including independent contractors—sidelined by coronavirus, plus sick pay to its part-time
            in-store shoppers. (In response to a recent walkoff by some of its shoppers who demanded more workplace
            protections, Instacart also announced it was providing free "health and safety kits" including a washable
            cloth mask, hand sanitizer, and a reusable forehead thermometer that workers could order from the
            company.)

            FreshDirect and Peapod delivery personnel are company employees. Walmart, which wasn't part of our
            ratings,
            uses DoorDash for deliveries.

            While those companies might recommend that deliverers wash their hands often, practice other hygiene
            measures, and stay home when they’re feeling sick, they can’t monitor whether drivers are actually taking
            those precautions, says Erin Hatton, an associate professor of sociology and a labor scholar at the
            University of Buffalo. “And without paid sick leave, workers are going to try to push through as much as
            they can,” Hatton says.

          <h3 class="highlight">If You’re Picking Up Prepacked Groceries</h3>
          <p>The steps are basically the same for this option as for delivery. If you’ve ordered and are merely having
            someone put the groceries in your car in a parking lot—an option at about 3,000 Walmart locations
            nationwide—consider opening your car door yourself rather than having the person bringing the items to
            your
            car touch the handle. And if you can tip on a supermarket’s app, do so rather than handing over cash.
            (Walmart’s employees aren’t permitted to take tips.)</p>
          <h3 class="highlight">If You're Buying Groceries in a Store</h3>
          <p>A key way to prevent the virus’s spread is to stay 6 feet away from other people. The CDC notes that's
            generally the distance within which people pick up coronavirus droplets through the air from a cough or
            sneeze. Such “social distancing” is a good strategy in any situation outside the home, Rogers says. Other
            ideas:

            Go shopping at a time that’s less busy. If you type in the store’s name and location in Google search, a
            box
            often will pop up showing when foot traffic there is highest.

            Wear a face covering. The new advice from the CDC on face masks is voluntary. The agency says the
            non-medical coverings can be "basic cloth or fabric masks." The New York City Health Department, which
            recently put out a directive to citizens to cover their faces when outside their home, defines a face
            covering as "any well-secured paper or cloth (like a bandana or scarf) that covers your mouth and nose,"
            and
            offers best practices for how to put it on, wear it, and remove it.

            It's not necessary to use surgical masks or N-95 respirators, the CDC stresses. "Those are critical
            supplies
            that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders," the agency
            says.

            Take germicide with you. Use it to wipe your hands and the cart before and after you shop.

            Use a credit or debit card. That way, you don’t have to hand over bills or receive change. Also, use your
            own pen to sign receipts. If you can, use a virtual payment system like Apple Pay so that you don't have
            to
            open your wallet at all.

            Editor’s Note: This article, originally published on March 9, 2020, has been updated to clarify our
            guidance
            on how to handle produce and food packaging, as well as news on Instacart's delivery service, how long
            coronaviruses live on cardboard, and whether to use a face covering.
